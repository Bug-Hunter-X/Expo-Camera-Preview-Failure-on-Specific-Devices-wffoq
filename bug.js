This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with specific devices or configurations.  The camera preview might fail to load, resulting in a blank screen or an error message. The error message may not be descriptive, making debugging difficult. This issue is particularly noticeable when certain permissions aren't granted or device settings conflict with the Expo Camera API.  Inconsistencies in the camera preview can occur between development and production builds, leading to unpredictable behavior.
